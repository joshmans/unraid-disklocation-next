 * Direction mode 1 is the only one implemented - confirmed by reading
 * tray_number_assign() in the original plugin's functions_devices.php AND
 * by checking a real installed copy's groups.json, where every group uses
 * this mode. Other modes are more involved reversed/bottom-up numbering
 * schemes not verified against real data, so a group using one is skipped
 * and reported rather than guessed at.
 *
 * tray_start_num is NOT the first tray's own number - trays are 1-indexed
 * starting just above it (tray_start_num "0" means the first real tray is
 * numbered 1, not 0). Confirmed by cross-referencing the classic plugin's
 * own live UI (which labels each bay with its tray number) against
 * locations.json on a real box: every assignment's UI-displayed bay label
 * was exactly its locations.json tray value minus 1 (tray 1 -> labeled "0",
 * tray 12 -> labeled "11", etc, with no tray-0 entries ever present).
 * Getting this wrong doesn't error - it just silently shifts every disk to
 * an adjacent bay and makes the last real tray look "out of range" for its
 * own declared grid, which is what real imported data on this box showed
 * before this was caught.
