// unraid-api's own GraphQL endpoint is served over HTTPS with Unraid's
// self-signed certificate, which never verifies against the system trust
// store. The rc.d script used to work around that by setting
// NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 for the whole process, which also silently
// disabled certificate checking for anything else Node did (any host, not
// just this one request) - flagged by the CA security review that landed
// the loopback-binding fix in #4. Doing the POST by hand with node:https
// lets certificate checking be skipped only for this one request.
//
// The test is "graphqlUrl points at this machine", not "is 127.0.0.1": the
// Settings tab pre-fills graphqlUrl from the address the browser used
// (guessGraphqlUrl), normally the server's own LAN address or hostname. Its
// certificate is just as self-signed, and a connection to one of this
// machine's own addresses never leaves the machine, so a certificate check
// has nothing to protect against. Requiring a loopback literal broke every
// install that kept the pre-filled URL ("self-signed certificate", /disks
// answered 502). Anything that resolves elsewhere still gets normal TLS
// verification.
//
// A hostname is resolved once here and the connection is then pinned to the
// address that was checked, so DNS cannot answer "local" for the check and
// "remote" for the connection.
